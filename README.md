# YuriPages

YuriPages is a theme made with BootStrap for novel authors. The main difference than other themes is that categorizing is mainly based on directory structure.

### Configurable Parameters

In the `[params]` section of the config file, these options are available:

`description`  : Part of the footer, describe the site in few words.

`author` : Part of the footer, your name. (It should actually named "maintainer" because there is another front-matter entry called "author".)
